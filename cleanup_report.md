# Project Cleanup & Organization Report

## Overview
This report outlines recommendations for organizing the `fikrly` project structure to improve maintainability and reduce clutter in the root directory.

## 1. Root Directory Cleanup
The root directory contains several script files that should be organized into dedicated folders.

- **`debug_media.py`**: This appears to be a utility script.
  - **Recommendation**: Move to `scripts/` or `frontend/management/commands/` if it's a Django management command.
- **`update_site_domain.py`**: A one-time or utility script for configuration.
  - **Recommendation**: Move to `scripts/`.
- **`frontend_dump.json`**: This is a data fixture containing initial company data.
  - **Recommendation**: Move to `frontend/fixtures/` (create the folder if it doesn't exist). This is the standard Django location for initial data.

## 2. Documentation
- **`audit_report.md`**: If this audit is complete, consider moving it to `docs/` or archiving it.
- **`cleanup_report.md`**: This file itself can be moved to `docs/` after action items are completed.

## 3. Static & Media Files
- **`staticfiles/`**: This directory is generated by `collectstatic`. Ensure it is added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing generated assets.
- **`media/`**: Ensure user-uploaded content is not committed to the repository (except for default placeholders if any).

## 4. Virtual Environments
- **`.venv/` & `.venv_win/`**: You have two virtual environment folders.
  - **Recommendation**: Stick to one standard naming convention (e.g., `.venv`) and remove the unused one to save disk space.

## 5. Action Plan
1. Create `frontend/fixtures/` directory.
2. Move `frontend_dump.json` to `frontend/fixtures/`.
3. Move `debug_media.py` and `update_site_domain.py` to `scripts/`.
4. Verify `.gitignore` includes `staticfiles/`, `media/`, and `*.pyc`.

2.  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules`
3.  `npm install`
4.  `Remove-Item frontend/middleware.py (append)`
